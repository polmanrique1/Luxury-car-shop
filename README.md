# Luxury Car Shop API

## Summary

Luxury Car Shop API is a backend application built with **Python** and **FastAPI**.  
Its main purpose is to manage a luxury car marketplace where users can search and purchase cars.

Some endpoints are protected using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to ensure secure authentication and authorization.  
The database is built with **SQLite** and is **automatically created** when the API starts.

##  Authentication

The API implements **JWT-based authentication** (JSON Web Tokens). 
Access to protected endpoints is restricted to authorized users; you must provide a valid **Bearer Token** in the authorization header to perform user-specific operations.

##  API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can explore and test the API using the interactive documentation generated by FastAPI:

* **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

##  Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to implement a **production-ready backend** using **FastAPI**. It focuses on industry-standard practices such as asynchronous database operations, secure dependency injection, and containerized deployment.
